This was caused by:\n1. Missing `React.memo` on card components leading to full re-renders\n2. CSS animations replaying on every render\n3. Heavy components \\(ResultCard is ~1000 lines with internal state\\)\n\n## Testing\n- [ ] Search \"musculoskeletal\" to get 87+ results\n- [ ] Scroll rapidly up and down - verify no white flashing\n- [ ] Expand drugs on a card, scroll away, scroll back - verify expansion state preserved\n- [ ] Click \"Load More\" - verify new cards animate, existing cards don''t\n- [ ] Toggle favorites - verify only the affected card re-renders\n\n## Technical Details\n- Build passes successfully\n- All existing functionality preserved \\(drug expansion, trial expansion, favorites, Load More\\)\n\n---\n\n[![Compound Engineered]\\(https://img.shields.io/badge/Compound-Engineered-6366f1\\)]\\(https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin\\) 🤖 Generated with [Claude Code]\\(https://claude.com/claude-code\\)\nEOF\n\\)\")",
